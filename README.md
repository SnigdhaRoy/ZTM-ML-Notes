## Machine Learning 101

### What is the goal of Machine Learning? 

**Computers** were brought into this world to make completing tasks more efficient for humans. 

The goal of **machine learning** is to make computers act more and more like humans. The more they act like humans, the more helpful they are for humans! 

### AI/Machine Learning/Data Science

**Artificial Intelligence** - human intelligence exhibited by machines.

**Narrow AI** - Machines can be just as good or even better than humans at certain tasks. Ex: detecting heart disease, playing chess, etc. Narrow AI is only good at one specific task extremely well. 

**Artifical General Intelligence (AGI)** - Extremely good at many human tasks (we are approaching this era soon)

**Machine Learning** -  a subset of AI. It's an approach to try and achieve AI through systems that want to find patterns through a set of data. Computers can do things without us saying, "do this, then do that". Stanford describes ML as the science of getting machines to act without humans specifying instructions. 

**Deep Learning** - Techniques for implementing machine learning. (also: deep neural networks)

**Data Science** - Simply put, analyzing data. There's a lot of overlap w. ML.
