##Machine Learning 101

###What is Machine Learning? 

**Computers** were brought into this world to make completing tasks more efficient for humans. 

The goal of **machine learning** is to make computers act more and more like humans. The more they act like humans, the more helpful they are for humans! 

###AI/Machine Learning/Data Science

**Artificial Intelligence** - human intelligence exhibited by machines.
**Narrow AI** - Machines can be just as good or even better than humans at certain tasks. Ex: detecting heart disease, playing chess, etc. Narrow AI is only good at one specific task extremely well.
