# ZTM-ML-Notes
Notes on Daniel Bourke + Andrei Neagoi's ML Course. 

## 1) Machine Learning 101

### i. What is the goal of Machine Learning? 

**Computers** were brought into this world to make completing tasks more efficient for humans. 

The goal of **machine learning** is to make computers act more and more like humans. The more they act like humans, the more helpful they are for humans! 

### ii. AI/Machine Learning/Data Science

**Artificial Intelligence** - human intelligence exhibited by machines.

**Narrow AI** - Machines can be just as good or even better than humans at certain tasks. Ex: detecting heart disease, playing chess, etc. Narrow AI is only good at one specific task extremely well. 

**Artifical General Intelligence (AGI)** - Extremely good at many human tasks (we are approaching this era soon)

**Machine Learning** -  a subset of AI. It's an approach to try and achieve AI through systems that want to find patterns through a set of data. Computers can do things without us saying, "do this, then do that". Stanford describes ML as the science of getting machines to act without humans specifying instructions. 

**Deep Learning** - Techniques for implementing machine learning. (also: deep neural networks)

**Data Science** - Simply put, analyzing data. There's a lot of overlap w. ML.

### iv. How did we get to Machine Learning? 
(Simplified version) We first used spreadsheets like excel to generate data and put it in an excel file to make business decisions. As companies got more idea, we created this idea of relational databases. We needed a better way to organize and understand things from data. Thus, came MySQL: this helped us read, write, and understand data of many different types. Then, in 2000s, we created this idea of "big data" since FB, Google, Twitter needed to store way more precise data for their customers. Then after, NoSQL + MongoDB came along to help us manage even more meta data. 

Machine Learning came along to automate and help us make data-driven decisions more efficiently. This was due to the growth in data and the improvements of CPU, GPU, and computation.
